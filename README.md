# Djangogram

### Getting Started
- Create a directory to hold the project and run `git clone https://github.com/etg624/Djangogram.git` inside of the directory
- Create a virtual environment folder in your project directory by running `virtualenv venv` in the root directory

The folder structure should look like this:
```
+--Root
| +--avybe
| +--venv
```
- Start the virtual evironment by running `source venv/bin/activate` in the root folder of the project
- `cd` into the `avybe` directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `python manage.py runserver` to start the server on port 8000
